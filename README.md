# spring-physics-simulation
#### Program for simulating behavior of a spring with custom parameters

This simulation can show in details how the spring shrinks by tracking points between *spring segments*.
These segments are equal by weight pieces of the spring. When simulation starts, all the segments have the same length due to equability of the tension, but then it changes.
This program is written to show, **how** it changes.
###### You can find russian description in project`s wiki [in progress]

## Setting up
All the parameters are located in **constants.h** file. Comments near to them describe what and how you need to change.
